# Markdown Cheatsheet

## Headers

Use '#' signs to designate header level. One '#' is the biggest header, and six '#' is the smallest header.

## Headers - Alternate

Alternatively, for a level one header you can type the header with any number of '==' beneath it, and for a level two header you can type any number of '-' beneath it.

## Paragraphs

Don't indent paragraphs with tabs or spaces.

To create a line break, end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return. You can also use an html \<br> tag.

## Bold Text

Make text bold by adding two asterisks (*) or two underscores ( _ ) before and after the text.  

Use asterisks for making text bold in the middle of a word.

**Bold text is bold**

## Italic

To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after the word. Use asterisks for italicizing in the middle of a word.

*Italicized text is italicized*

## Bold + Italics

Add three underscores or asterisks before and after a word to bold and italicize the text.

## Blockquotes

To create a block quote, add a > character in front of a paragraph.

> Block quoted text is block quoted

### Multi-paragraph block quotes

To block quote multiple paragraphs, begin every line with a > character.

> Text
>
> Text

### Nesting

Add additional > characters for nested block quotes

> Text
>> Nested Text

You can use other markdown elements inside of block quotes.

### Code Blocks

Make code blocks by surrounding text with back ticks (`).

`I am a code block`

### Tables

Make tables with the following structure

><p>| Header 1 | Header 2 | <br>
>| --------- | --------- | <br>
>| text here | text here | <br>
>| text here | text here | </p>

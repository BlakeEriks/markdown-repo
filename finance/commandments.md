# The 10 Finanace Commandments

Thou shall not worry, for worry is the most unproductive of all human activities. People get so busy worrying about yesterday or tomorrow, that they tend to forget about today, and today is all we have to work with. Turn off the news and get to work; look at some charts and stop being such a nervous nelly. 

Thou shall not be fearful, for most of the things we fear never come to pass. Fear is simply an emotion, when we fear something, we give it power. If we refuse to concede to our fear, then there's nothing to be such a chicken about. 

Thou shall not cross bridges before you come to them, for no one yet has succeeded in accomplishing this. Solve the issues that are in front of you,  if you have $1,000 your goal should be how to get it to $2,000. Not worrying about which broker will get you the best price on your 5 shares of Apple. 




Thou shall face each problem as it comes, you can only handle one at a time anyways. This is why we say to start small (with $0), and learn first. It's much easier to get embarrassed by a stupid trade idea, than to lose a nice chunk of that capital to a cocky mistake. 

Thou shall not take problems to bed with you, as they make for rough spooning. Trades fail all the time. You learn from them and move on, or you can sit there and bitch and moan at your own mistake that does you no good. Learn and move on, there's always another trade (if you understand risk management, of course).

Thou shall not borrow other people’s problems, they can better care for them than you can. Unless that person is paying you for help, don't waste your time. I cannot count how many times I have spoken to a new trader complaining about his buddy losing $10’s of thousands of dollars trading trash, yet the same friend is either doing nothing to learn or wants to follow in the friends footsteps (with the delusional idea that they will do it smarter with no experience). 

Thou shall not try to relive yesterday, if the words shoulda, coulda, or woulda are in your vocabulary better chuck them asap. Nothing more useless than telling someone what you could have done, because you didn't, and that's all that matters.    

Thou shall be a good listener, for only when you listen do you hear ideas different from your own. Hearing is a sense, listening is an art, and when you can listen successfully, anything is possible. Remember the old adage you have two ears and one mouth. 

Thou shall not become bogged down by frustration, as frustration clouds your judgement and interferes with positive action. When a trade fails, there's nothing worse one could do than to try and make it back. That is the gambler's mentality, and gamblers lose. Step away from the computer, go to the gym, read a book, or do whatever it is you do to decompress. Come back the next day or week with a fresh mindset and look forward. 

Thou shalt count thy blessings. Never overlook the smallest ones, as the smallest ones compound over time. Same with trading, if you made money, regardless of the amount, that was a blessing. The more you get in the habit of making money, the more it should compound over time (if you can keep the losers in line).

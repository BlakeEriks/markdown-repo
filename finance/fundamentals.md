# Stock Market Fundamentals

## Beta

**Beta** is how volatile a stock is compared to the overall market. We refer to the market as the SPY (S&P 500). The SPY's beta is always 1, and a stock with a beta less than one is less volatile than the market.

## P/E

**P/E** is the share price divided by the earnings they bring in. A stock with a P/E around 12 tends to be a stable company. The higher the P/E, the higher the future growth potential the general public believes the stock to have.
